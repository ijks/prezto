Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.

This is my (`ijks`) current setup of Prezto. I suggest you go to the [original repo](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) if you want to try it out for yourself. However, feel free to look at my changes for inspiration.
